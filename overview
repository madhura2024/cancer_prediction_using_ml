Cancer Prediction Project Workflow (Cheat Sheet)  
1. Get the data  

Load the dataset directly from the internet.  

Remove extra spaces from text columns.  

Drop useless columns like IDs.  

Remove rows with missing data and duplicates.  

2. Prepare features and labels  

Features include all columns except for the target.  

Labels refer to the target column (“Class” or “Diagnosis”).  

3. Split the data  

Divide the data into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%).  

4. Scale the features  

Use scaling to normalize feature values. This puts them all on a similar scale.  

5. Train machine learning models  

Train Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM using the training data.  

Use enough iterations for Logistic Regression to reach convergence.  

6. Evaluate models  

Predict labels using the test data.  

Calculate the accuracy score for each model.  

7. Train deep learning model (optional)  

Build a small neural network.  

Train it on the scaled training data.  

Validate during training.  

Evaluate using the test data.  

8. Make predictions on new user input  

Ask the user to input all feature values at once.  

Scale these inputs the same way as the training data.  

Use each trained model to predict if a case is benign or malignant.  

Show prediction results as simple text.
